 DR1 is the flagship television channel of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation. It became Denmarkâ€™s first television station when it began broadcasting in 1951. 

 When DR1 got a new design, a new Airlook, I got involved in implementing the dynamic design ideas and helped migrating their custom Node.js/After Effects render farm to modern MacOS hardware.

 I also set up the browser-based front-end for the DR1 Airlook in their inhouse angularjs system 'Give Me A Break' used by their speakers and marketing department to set up and time signs and graphic elements and to schedule just-in-time renders for playout.
 
 The task was to set up a system where the advanced ideas the DR Design department had for the new designs on the main Danish tv channel could work in an automated broadcast world.
