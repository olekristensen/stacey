  In 2013-2015 Recoil Performance Group explores the scenographic potentials of stereographic projections.

  With access to spectral comb filters and glasses it is possible to develop our existing minimalist scenery of dynamic trompe l'oeil projections with live manipulations of the perceived distance and scale of the stage space.

  The initial research took place in Culture Yard Elsinore at the Click festival 2013 where I made the first tests with spectral comb filters. In January 2014 the project was developed further during a residency at 3LD Art and Technology Center in NYC. We were happy to enjoy the local participation of ITP and Parsons students Maria Paula Saba, Bernado Schorr.

  In may 2014 the Click Festival will once again host recoil performance group to create an installation based on the STEREO concept.
