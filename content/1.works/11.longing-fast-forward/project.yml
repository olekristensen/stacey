  Longing - Fast Forward is a long-term art project with the people living on the edge of the Greenland inland-ice.

  From the summer 2012 an automated research station has monitored a small settlement throughout the circle of one year. Based on performative experiments with local participants and structural collection of video and sound, the recordings shape a large scale audio-visual installation, showing the current inner / human and outer / environmental change of pace.
