 <p>Ole Kristensen is a visual artist, programmer and scenographer. At the intersection of art and science he develops and appropriates new technology, creating works with software at the core.</p>
 <p>His work ranges from stage performances and modern dance to large scale interactive installations. In his work he focuses on the behavioural aspects of interactivíty, adaptivity, and generativity. </p>
 <p>He is driven by a playful urge to connect electronics, gadgets, visuals and moving objects in seemingly impossible combinations. Through his visual arts practice he has gained knowledge in diverse fields within electronics and programming.</p>
 <p>In 2014 he was awarded a 2 year work grant from the <a href="http://www.kunst.dk/kunstomraader/scenekunst/nyheder/37-legater-er-blevet-uddelt-til-et-dynamisk-og-levende-scenekunstmiljoe/">Danish Arts Council</a> with the following motivation:<br />
 <em>[He] has a unique and original approach to all forms of time-based and digital media, placing him among the most interesting software artists in the world. Ole Kristensen is awarded a two-year work scholarship so he can concentrate on the creative study of digital, programmed and cross-aesthetic arts, and enjoy peace to navigate through the many artistic expressions that turn out.</em>

 <blockquote><p>It is a great pleasure to create something that can react, adapt, and generate new forms from itself or it's surroundings. My main interest lies in this creation of dynamic aestetic phenomena. When an artwork is running software the challenge is to make the behavioural aspects of the piece constitute it's aestetic qualities. </p></blockquote>
